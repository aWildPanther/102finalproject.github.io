            <h2>Social challenges</h2>
            <p>Home Automation - Home automation faces challenges with devices like cameras, speakers, and smart locks that collect personal data, such as schedules, video footage, and voice recordings. If not properly secured, these devices are at risk of hacking or unauthorized surveillance. Hackers have been known to access smart cameras and doorbells to monitor residents and their comings and goings. This can expose homeowners to privacy violations and theft. Smart home technology can lead to security vulnerabilities and distrust, which deters potential users. 
On the other hand, It can also lead to an improved quality of life because it offers convenience and safety, such as remotely controlling things like lights, locks, and appliances. Cameras and smart locks that are controlled remotely can provide real-time monitoring and improve home safety. Home automation comes at a cost. Many of these systems are expensive, which makes them inaccessible to lower-income families. Smart devices are not standardized, so they may not all work together. This can cause frustration for the user and limits scalability. The more devices connected, the higher the chance for these devices to be hacked. Taking security measures is essential, but not all users know how to take security measures. Home automation brings convenience, energy efficiency, and security but comes with challenges like data security, affordability, and security.</p>
